Today and last night, I was researching papers and methods to accomplish my task. I found a few resources, papers for me to read and look into: *[Automatic Simplification of Scientific Texts...](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3497/paper-242.pdf)* and *[Simplex: a lexical text simplification architecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.07002)*  

I found out about **SARI**, a way to measure the complexity of sentences in NLP tasks, and I tried writing down the problems and challenges I can imagine for each task, *Lexical simplification*, *Syntactical simplification* and *Stylistic simplification*. I made some decision about the UI of the finished "product".  

I feel it is better for me to write things out to "think" about them, kind of like thinking outloud. I have also gotten into the habit of "chatting" with chatgpt about my thoughts and ideas, maybe get some insight as well as shedding some light on challenges I had not thought of before.  

I've decided to keep a bit of a log here on Github to try to document my process through this project.
